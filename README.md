Challenge 13
## Mapping_Earthquakes

### On the map developed through the project, earthquake data from the world, which is retrieved from the U.S. Geological Survey website, is visualized in an informative way. The magnitude and location of earthquakes are represented by size and color of the markers. The map can only display the earthquakes with magnitude of 4.5 or greater by selecting layer. In addition, the Tectonic Plate layer draws fault lines on the map to illustrate the relationship between seismic activity and tectonic plates.
